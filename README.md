# 🧘‍♂️ Zen — Master of Skidding and Delusion

Another day, another exposed skid. This time it’s **Zen**, the self-proclaimed “dev” who couldn’t code a calculator without StackOverflow and divine intervention.

---

### 🧠 Proof of Delusion  
Claims to push updates he didn’t make. Constantly leeching from Drexxy. Always asking for help — never solo.

### 🧬 Claims Other Peoples’ Cheat Sources Are His  

Branded **Sofmain V3** as his own and resold it.

### 💀 Summary  

Zen is what you get when ChatGPT, Pastebin, and unchecked overconfidence converge.
He's not a developer — he's a case study in script-kiddie theatrics.

---

### ⚠️ Final Note  

It's OK to be a beginner.  
It's OK to learn and ask questions.  
But it is **NEVER OK** to be a **skid**, it is **NEVER OK** to be a **paster**.

You're not Elliot Alderson. You're not DedSec. You're not Payson.
Pasting and getting yourself exposed is going to ruin your future opportunities.
Don’t fake it — learn it.
