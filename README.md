Another day, another exposed skid. This time it’s **Zen**, the self-proclaimed “dev” who couldn’t code a calculator without StackOverflow and divine intervention.

### claiming other peoples sources for cheats are his 

for example branding sofmains v3 base branding it zen selling it posting it taking credit for other peoples work using sofmains source for cheats not swapping drivers cause he dosent know how to swap it changing names but hes so stupid keeping the same watermark and menu design cause he dosent know how to swap or change it so instead he clearly used chatgpt to update it cause he has no idea what hes doing ill show sofmains source/menu and show "zens base"

### sofmain pic

### 💀 Summary:  
Zen is what happens when ChatGPT, pastebin, and zero shame come together.  
He’s not a dev — he’s just a drama episode waiting to happen.
